            There is not a whole lot of crafting professions in skyrim, but there are three main important ones that
            this guide will cover. First, we have smithing. Smithing is the crafting skill for combat, providing the
            ability to create and improve (or temper) weapons and armor. The higher your skill level, the more you can
            improve weapons and armor. The Smithing skill tree has a total of 10 perks, requiring a total of 10 perk
            points to fill. Secondly, we have Enchanting. Enchanting is the ability to add magical effects to weapons,
            armor, and clothes. Increasing this skill increases the amount of charges available when creating an
            enchanted item and the quality of the enchantment that can be placed on that item. The Enchanting skill tree
            has a total of 9 perks, requiring a total of 13 perk points to fill. Each level in the Enchanting skill
            increases the strength of enchantments in a quadratic fashion to a maximum of +25% effectiveness at level
            100. Which enchantments can be applied to a particular item varies by item type. Lastly we have the Alchemy
            profession. Alchemy is the art of brewing potions and poisons by combining ingredients with matching
            effects, using an Alchemy Lab. Initially, you don't know the effects of ingredients and must discover them
            by eating ingredients, reading recipes, or brewing them into potions. Some NPCs (notably alchemists) may
            offer you basic recipes while conversing. Perks in this skill allow discovering more effects by eating;
            increase the effectiveness of created potions and poisons; remove the positive effects from poisons and the
            negative effects from potions; and allow you to gather twice as many ingredients from plants. The alchemy
            skill tree has 9 perks, requiring 15 perk points to fill. Each level in the alchemy skill increases the
            effectiveness of crafted potions and poisons by 0.5% for +50% effectiveness at level 100 compared to level
            0.

            Smithing
        </h3>
        <p>
            Smithing is the first and most primitive profession in Skyrim. It is the easiest and most important one to
            pick up.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Enchanting is the secondmost profession you will run into in skyrim. It's not quite as imporant as smithing
            is, but it is still a very powerful and useful profession.

        <p>
            Alchemy is the last profession you are likely to master. While alchemy is the most difficult and most time
            consuming to master it is extreamly powerful when combined with the other professions.
