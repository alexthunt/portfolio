      <p>Our
        next Photo Safari to Kenya has now been scheduled, departing May 5th and returning
        May 23rd. Come join us and take some beautiful pictures like these two Grevy's
        zebras nursing their young at Samburu National Reserve. Our flight will leave
        from New York for London, where you will have dayrooms reserved before flying
        all night to Nairobi, Kenya. To provide the finest in personal attention, this
        tour will be limited to no more than sixteen persons. Game drives will take
        place early each morning and late each afternoon to provide maximum opportunity
        for game viewing when the animals are most active. We will visit five game reserves
        to allow for a variety of animal populations and scenery.
        This lion is relaxing in
        the late afternoon sun. Notice the scar under his right ear. He might have received
        that when he was booted out of his pride as a young lion. We will be spending
        most nights in tented camps listening to the night sounds of hunters like this
        magnificent animal. Enjoy visiting native villages and trading with the local
        businessmen. Birding enthusiasts will enjoy adding to their bird lists with
        Kenya's over 300 species of birds. View the beginning of the annual migration
        of millions of wildebeest, a spectacular sight. Each spring, the wildebeest
        travel from the Serengeti Plain to the Mara in search of water and grass. Our
        optional excursions include ballooning over the Masai Mara, fishing on Lake
        Victoria (the largest freshwater lake in the world), camel rides at Amboseli
        Serena Lodge, and golfing at the Aberdare Country Club
        All safari vehicles have
        roof hatches for unobstructed photography opportunities. Capture photos like
        this one of a reticulated giraffe. Window seats are guaranteed for all members
        of the group. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be provided each day. Professional
        guides will accompany the group at all times. Our English-speaking guides have
        years of experience conducting safaris. Our pool of guides includes ornithologist
        JoAnne Rife, zoologist Jenny Williams, anthropologist Christina Elizabeth, and
        naturalist Richard Newland. Private air transport will whisk us to our more
        distant game reserves. This is truly a trip of a lifetime. We expect the openings
        to fill quickly, so make your reservation now!
